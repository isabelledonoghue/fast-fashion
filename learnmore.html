    <h2> Our Purpose: promoting a fashion industry that values people and our environment over fleeting trends and personal profit. </h2>

    <h2> The Problem </h2>
    <p> The environmental and societal impacts of the fast fashion industry, and how blame is often focused on individuals (culture) but we need to fight for systemic change (industry and policy) and brand accountability. You should care about this cause because of the need to promote creative diversity in fashion, protecting the environment and combating climate change, and fighting for the basic rights of garmet workers. </p>

    <h2> Who This Impacts </h2>
    <p> 1. Garmet workers <br> 2. Animals and their habitats <br> 3. Consumers <br> 4. Independent artists and small businesses <br> 5. Our Earth! </p>

    <h2> Common Misconceptions </h2>
    <p> 1. Luxury fashion does not equal sustainable fashion -> A high price tag does not mean that worker exploitation is less likely. <br> 2. The sustainability buzzword, also known as greenwashing -> Brands use this to appeal to a larger consumer base without actually guaranteeing sustainable or ethical practices.
