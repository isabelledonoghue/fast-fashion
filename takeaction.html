    <h2>Personal Impact</h2>

    <p> Oftentimes, the blame for the negative impact of fast fashion falls on consumers. Some people pressure others to shop "sustainably", but fashion branded as sustainable can sometimes be expensive and unethically produced. Instead, there are a multitude of ways that individuals can avoid fast fashion and shop more ethically. 

     <p> 1. Buy and thrift second hand clothes -> These pieces are sustainable, one of a kind, and affordable.<br> 2. Donate to activist organizations -> If you have the means, organizations such as <a   href="https://www.fashionrevolution.org/donate/">Fashion Revolution</a> can use donations to support their movements. <br> 3. Shop from independent artists or small buisnesses -> The culture surrounding fast fashion relies on brief trends that hinder creative diversity. </p>

    <h2>Industry and Policy Change</h2>
    <p> As previously mentioned, the blame for the success of the fast fashion industry can often fall on the shoulders of consumers. However, brands and governments must also be held accountable for their role in its prevalence. Below are the main concepts that activists are currently addressing in their fight against powerful fast fashion corporations. </p>
    <p> 1. Policy change -> calls for a more active role of governments in regulating the fashion industry and worker conditions. <br> 2. Industry change -> calls for brand transparency, which will force big corporations to be accountable for their employees, consumers, and the general public. </p>

    <h2>Learn and Educate</h2>
    <p> The start for any activist who wants to advocate for a cause is educating themselves on the movement and subject. This includes the history of the issue, current implications of the injustice, and the ideals of the activist movement. Below are some reliable sources that you can read and share to spread awareness about fast fashion and the movement against it.</p>
